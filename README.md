# HR-Attrition-Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on *analyzing employee attrition* to identify key drivers of workforce turnover and provide actionable insights to support HR and strategic decision-making. The analysis combines *interactive dashboarding using Power BI* and *predictive modeling using Excel-based Logistic Regression* to reveal patterns and high-risk segments within the organization.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze organizational data to uncover patterns related to employee attrition.
- Visualize attrition trends by job satisfaction, role, department, and more using Power BI.
- Apply *Logistic Regression in Excel* to predict attrition probabilities based on various factors.
- Provide strategic recommendations to improve employee retention.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- *Power BI* – for data visualization and interactive dashboard  
- *Microsoft Excel* – for data cleaning, preprocessing, and logistic regression modeling  
- *Power Query* – used in Excel for transforming and preparing raw HR data

## 🧠 Predictive Modeling – Logistic Regression

Using Excel, a logistic regression model was built to:
- Identify high-risk attrition cases.
- Quantify the impact of variables like:
  - *Age*
  - *Distance from Home*
  - *Overtime*
  - *Years Since Last Promotion*
  - *Job Involvement*
  - *Number of Companies Worked*
  - *Relationship Satisfaction*
  - and more.

The model assigns a *probability score* for each employee, helping HR teams take *proactive retention actions*.

## 💡 Key Insights

- Employees with *low job involvement (34%)* and *poor job satisfaction (23%)* are most likely to leave.
- *Overtime workers* show a significantly higher attrition rate (31%) than others.
- *Sales Representatives* and *HR department* have the highest attrition among roles.
- *Young, single employees* or those living far from work are more at risk.
- Employees with no recent promotions or poor relationships with their manager also show higher likelihood of exit.
