## 🧠 Predictive Modeling – Logistic Regression (Excel)

A logistic regression model was developed in Excel to:

- Identify employees at high risk of attrition
- Evaluate the influence of variables such as:
  - Age  
  - Distance from Home  
  - Overtime  
  - Years Since Last Promotion  
  - Job Involvement  
  - Number of Companies Worked  
  - Relationship Satisfaction  

Each employee receives a **probability score** that supports proactive HR interventions and retention strategies.

## 💡 Key Insights

- Employees with **low job involvement (34%)** and **low job satisfaction (23%)** are most prone to leave.  
- **Overtime workers** exhibit a higher attrition rate (31%) compared to non-overtime employees.  
- **Sales Representatives** and those in the **HR department** face the highest attrition rates.  
- **Young, single employees**, especially those living far from work, are at elevated risk.  
- Lack of **recent promotions** or **poor manager relationships** significantly correlate with higher attrition.
